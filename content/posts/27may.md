You may be wondering: what is BBEdit? Basically, BBEdit is a text editor made by Bare Bones Software. Have you heard of TextWrangler? Well, BBEdit is made by the same people!

But why is it so good? Well...

- It’s free! (You can pay for more features, though)
- It’s exactly like TextWrangler! (No, literally, look [here](https://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/#familiar))
- It’s extremely customisable!
- It’s a Universal app! (runs great on Apple Silicon and Intel!)

In fact, the text editor I’m using right now is BBEdit!

So, if you’re looking for a great text editor, try BBEdit!
